Good day. I'm the original God, the one created everything including you.
In your language, it can be said that I'm a lover of symmetry.
Currently, my secret gardens are full of boys and girls.
All the gardens are beautiful, I would love to be able to take a photo to show you, but it's too cloudy...
As I'm too tired, let's play a game.
If you can uncover all the clouds, your wanted treasure is awaiting at the end of our conversation.
Let's look at the first garden!
This garden has the size of 3.
 'b' means that a boy is standing there.
 'g' means that a girl is standing there.
 '?' means that it's cloudy, and there's a boy or a girl right there.
You can ask me at most 9 questions, each in the format of "x1 y1 x2 y2",
I'll tell you if one of the shortest paths from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) including the 2 end points is symmetric.
A path is symmetric if and only if it's the same as its reverse. For example: gbg, bggb, gbgbg, ggbbgg are symmetric.
After exactly 9 questions, you have to tell me the boy/girl configuration in this garden, all rows combined as a single string.
Let's go!
